                        Since 2018, I have been working at IBM in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/z-transaction-processing-facility">z/TPF Development Lab</a>.
                        I develop and maintain the following database access middleware for the z/TPF operating system:<br/>
                        - <b>z/TPF support for MongoDB:</b> An interface to legacy z/TPFDF databases which allows remote clients to access legacy data on z/TPF using MongoDB client libraries<br/>
                        - <b>z/TPF file system support:</b> Support for a POSIX-compliant file system with additional functionality for the z/TPF system, including process and system pseudo-file systems<br/>
                        - <b>z/TPF logical record cache support:</b> Support for in-memory caches which can be accessed by any application running on a z/TPF system
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Prior to working with IBM, I worked as an independent contractor for HireWare. At HireWare, I contributed designs and prototypes in a fast-paced startup environment in the staffing industry.
                        As the sole developer on the team, I learned how to navigate an existing Ruby on Rails code base and refined the existing software into a prototype of a minimum viable product.

                    <p>
                        I was granted a Bachelor of Science in Computer & Information Sciences at the State University of New York at Potsdam in 2017.
                        In my undergraduate career, I became familiar with computing concepts including algorithm analysis, operating system design, and agile methodologies.
                        I served as a teaching assistant in the Computer & Information Sciences department, assisting students with laboratory assignments and reinforcing concepts taught in class.

                                z/TPFDF remote subfile support provides the capability to store data for z/TPFDF subfiles in remote
                                data stores while z/TPFDF applications continue to read and update remote subfiles as if the data was stored locally on the z/TPF system.<br/><br/>
                                As a developer for this project, I designed and implemented code that transforms binary data in an arbitrary format into BSON (Binary JSON),
                                and transmits the BSON data to a MongoDB server running on a remote system.<br/><br/>
                                I also contributed to the design and implementation of graceful fault tolerance for this system.

                                In 2020, IBM began a concerted effort to replace racially and culturally discriminatory language with more inclusive language across code and content.<br/><br/>
                                I contributed to this effort by identifying offensive terminology in my team's existing code and documentation, proposing replacement terminology,
                                and coordinating the changes with other teams as necessary.
