                <h3>z/TPF dynamically resizable logical record cache support</h3>
                <p>worked on infrastructure improvements to <span class="nowrap">z/TPF's</span> logical record cache system. added support for dynamically resizing caches without losing existing data—previously you had to delete and recreate the entire cache, which meant repopulating everything from scratch. also implemented a time-initiated sweeper program that monitors caches for expired entries. separately, reduced MIPS consumption and processing time when adding entries to full caches by optimizing the castout process—particularly important for time-sensitive operations. these changes made it much more practical to use very large caches in time-sensitive applications.</p>

                <h3>z/TPF business events support for multiple unordered dispatch queues</h3>
                <p>helped extend <span class="nowrap">z/TPF's</span> business events support to handle multiple unordered dispatch queues. previously, business events shared a single system default queue, which meant that if one event encountered transmission errors or timeouts, it could delay processing of completely unrelated events. implemented support for separating events across multiple queues based on destination, volume, or other criteria—so issues on one queue don't impact others. specifically adapted the traditional <span class="nowrap">z/TPF</span> database data event processing path to work with multiple queues. also added support for increasing the maximum number of dispatch queues beyond the default limit of 20, providing more flexibility in business event environment configuration.</p>

                <h3>method for avoiding repeated fatal errors during message streaming processing that uses transaction scopes</h3>
                <p>the title's wordy, i know. this is about resiliency in exactly-once message streaming systems! a message streaming system uses transaction scopes to ensure the atomicity of working with the message queue. if a fatal error occurs after popping a message from the queue, the transaction scope caises the message to reappear on the queue. this ensures that the message is not lost before it can be sent to a remote system - it can be retried. but if something causes repeated errors with a specific message, then that fatal error is going to keep happening over and over again. as a result of the repeated error, the message might be retransmitted multiple times, and processing of the queue will block as this message is stuck on the queue. the paper talks about how you can use fatal error intercept functions to move those messages to an error queue as part of process exit, preventing the message streaming system from getting stuck on that message.</p>

                <h3>centralized database system with geographically partitioned data</h3>
                <p>centralized database system that enables compliance with data localization laws without requiring application redesign. many countries require that data about their citizens be physically stored within their borders, which traditionally meant partitioning databases geographically — complex and risky. this patent describes a method wherein the database manager transparently handles geographic storage requirements: when a document is created, the system determines the required storage location based on attributes like citizenship or address, creates a remote copy in that geographic location, and modifies the local copy to contain only location metadata. applications can continue reading and writing documents as if they're stored locally, while the database manager automatically routes requests to the correct geographic storage. with this approach, there's no need to redesign applications around geographic partitioning.</p>
